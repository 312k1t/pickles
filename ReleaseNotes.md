# Pickles Release Notes## v2.0.0 - 2015-11-03### Breaking Change- Pickles uses version 3 of the Gherkin parser, and as such requires .NET 4.5. The new parser is a lot smaller and should be faster too.## v1.2.3 - 2015-10-06### Bugs Fixed- In the DHtml version, the alignment of the keywords (Given, When, Then) was fixed for non-English languages ([#219](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/219))## v1.2.2 - 2015-09-24### Bugs Fixed- The PowerShell version now correctly traces relative paths from the current directory ([#216](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/216))## v1.2.1 - 2015-08-14### Bugs Fixed- In the Html version, the alignment of the keywords (Given, When, Then) was fixed for non-English languages ([#209](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/209))- A NullReferenceException in the MSTest provider was fixed when the test results also contain ordinary unit test results in addition to the SpecFlow results ([#212](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/212))## v1.2.0 - 2015-07-28### New Feature- In the DHtml version, there are now links to hide/show the navigation, and to collapse/expand all nodes in the navigation ([#204](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/204))### Bugs Fixed- The command line version no longer silently fails when an error occurs. You will need to adapt the configuration in order to get more information from the error ([#202]((https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/202))- The issue of failing silently in case the full filename is too long has been fixed ([#199](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/199))## v1.1.0 - 2015-05-12### New Feature- In both the DHtml and Html versions: Align scenario keywords to the right side so that step texts start from the same position ([#195](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/195))### Bugs Fixed- Abbreviations displayed incorrectly with spaces between letters ([#192](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/192))## v1.0.1 - 2015-03-31### Bugs Fixed- In the DHtml version, feature wide tags with capitals can not be filtered on ([#194](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/194))- Tables in background for Word & Excel  ([#191](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/191))## v1.0.0 - 2014-12-15### Breaking Change- Support for the nAnt runner has been discontinued. nAnt users can migrate by using nAnt's capabilities to call the command line runner of Pickles. ([#179](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/179))### Bug Fix- The checkmark/cross icon in the GUI client did not always show the cross icon when appropriate, and its state could be changed by the user.

This reflects our belief that the Living Documentation is a first class output of the software development process.### New Features- The command line and powershell runners now return an error code of 0 when everything went fine, and 1 if there was an error.- The HTML and DHTML output versions no longer horizontally spread tables.- The GUI version has an icon## v0.19.0 - 2014-11-25### Breaking Change- DITA support has been discontinued.

If you override the .css files, you will need to update your workflow to account for that.### Bug(s) Fixed- Fixed issue where multiple results files for a single feature causes exceptions when processing scenario outline examples ([#123](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/123))- Fixed issue where pickles would crash when a specified test results file does not exist ([#126](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/126))## v0.17.4 - 2014-06-04### Bug(s) Fixed- Description blocks are rendered as code elements in DHtml version ([#118](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/118))## v0.17.3 - 2014-05-28### Bug(s) Fixed- PowerShell version works again## v0.17.2 - 2014-05-28Some things went wrong during the publication of versions 0.17.0 and 0.17.1.

This will come in handy if you need to partition your test runs.

Yay!- All production code and test code now use the excellent [System.IO.Abstraction](https://github.com/tathamoddie/System.IO.Abstractions) library and its TestingHelpers classes.- We are using build services provided by [MyGet](http://www.myget.org/)## v0.13.1 - 2013-12-20### Bug(s) Fixed- DHTML uses the Feature's description for the Background ([#74](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/74))- Nuget manifest should mention PicklesDoc instead of only Jeffrey Cameron ([#84](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/84))- Crash when a feature is not present in the test result (with NUnit) ([#85](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/85))## v0.13.0 - 2013-11-29### New Feature(s)- The UI version now includes the option to generate each selected output format in its own directory ([#78](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/78))### Bug(s) Fixed- Left nav bug fix in DHTML format ([#73](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/73))- DHTML uses the Feature's description for the Background ([#74](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/74))## v0.12.1 - 2013-10-28### Bug(s) Fixed- Fixes a .NET runtime version issue caused by combining all Pickles runners in one directory.

Refer to the wiki page for instructions on how to configure SpecRun correctly: [Integrating Test Results From SpecRun](http://www.picklesdoc.com/#!Pages/IntegratingTestResultsFromSpecRun.md).### Bug(s) Fixed- Please implement marking ignored test cases with yellow sign rather than red for all Test Result providers (not just MSTest) ([#47](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/47))- Remove duplication of example feature files ([#50](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/issues/50))- Adding background to features in word ([#58](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/58))- Handle cucumber feature with no scenarios ([#59](https://github.com/picklesdoc/pickles/pull/59))## Older Releases without Release Notes- v0.9 - 2013-07-23- v0.8 - 2012-12-17- v0.7 - 2012-08-07- v0.6 was skipped- v0.5 - 2012-03-13- v0.4 - 2012-01-20- v0.3 - 2011-12-13- v0.2 - 2011-11-14- v0.1 - 2011-10-22
