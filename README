Introduction
============

The pickles library is intended to be an open source documentation generator that works on SpecFlow feature files in .NET.  It will scan the .feature files and generate HTML output based on the content of the files, plus the folder hierarchy.  Eventually, it will take advantage of a set of meta tags to add things like images to the generated documentation.
